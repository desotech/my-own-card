# my-own-card

udacity project "my own card

First from lesson 4.9 i changed the ConstraintLayout to a RelativeLayout with the given code

Relative layout is my option so that i can overlap views and keep the same stucture both in landscape and portrait.

Then i removed the action bar by changing the styles.xml
    <style name="AppTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar">
I inserted the image that would be using at the drawable folder
    
created the imageview with wrap content and center crop. it was important to be centered in the screen and look good both in landscape and portrait.

created the textview "is this moving". choose colors for text and background. position it at the top center and give it a margin of 12dp

created the textview "yes". choose colors for text and background. position it botom left and give it a margin of 12dp

created the textview "no". choose colors for text and background. position it botom right and give it a margin of 12dp
