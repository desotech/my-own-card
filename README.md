# my-own-card

udacity project "my own card

First from lesson 4.9 i change the ConstraintLayout to a RelativeLayout with the given code
Relative layout is my option so that i can overlap views and keep the same stucture both in landscape and portrait.
Then i removed the action bar by changing the styles.xml
    <style name="AppTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar">
I inserted the image at the drawable folder
created the textview "is this moving". choose colors for text and background. position it at the top center and give it a margin of 12dp
created the textview "yes". choose colors for text and background. position it botom left and give it a margin of 12dp
created the textview "no". choose colors for text and background. position it botom right and give it a margin of 12dp
